Arduino Snake Game

Objective: The Game Snake is a classic video game remade using an Arduino board,
an LED matrix, and a joystick. In this game, players control a snake using the joystick 
and aim to increase their score by successfully eating apples. The challenge is to avoid
colliding with the snake's own body or the game boundaries.

Components:

LED Matrix: This serves as the game screen, displaying the snake, apples, and game environment.

Joystick: Used for controlling the snake's movement. The joystick allows players to navigate 
the snake in different directions.

Arduino Microcontroller: Manages the game's logic, including controlling the snake's movement,
tracking the score, detecting collisions, and updating the LED matrix display.
